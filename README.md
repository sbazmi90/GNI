 *******************************************************************************************

Problem 1:


Solar system:


Write the Hamiltonian for planets and sun in the solar system and, compute all the orbits. Also, The energy and
momentum of each planet should be calculated. The problem is solved with different numeric methods to compare
their accuracy. These methods are:


Forward Euler
Backward Euler
Symplectic Euler
Heun
Stormer-Verlet


There is a data set for this problem. It has some information.

Problem 2:




Integrate the system of point vortex equations on the plane, according to the
hamilotonian Dynamics.

Numerically integrate the point vortex equations using the two-stage symplectic
Runge Kutta method and the four-stage explicit Runge Kutta method.

 *******************************************************************************************

## Problem 1: Geometric itegration of solar system.


We assume that the solar system is a ten body problem.

$\bullet$ We numerically integrate the solar system using the symplectic Euler method and the Stormer-Verlet method. 

$\bullet$ The final integration time should be t = 1000 years.

$\bullet$ Repeat the above experiment using the forward Euler, backward Euler and Heun's method.

$\bullet$ Plot the time series of the absolute error of the total energy for all the above methods.


Write the Hamiltonian for planets and sun in the solar system and, compute all the orbits. Also, The energy and
momentum of each planet should be calculated. The problem is solved with different numeric methods to compare
their accuracy. These methods are:


Forward Euler
Backward Euler
Symplectic Euler
Heun
Stormer-Verlet


There is a data set for this problem. It has some information.

Problem 2:




Integrate the system of point vortex equations on the plane, according to the
hamilotonian Dynamics.

Numerically integrate the point vortex equations using the two-stage symplectic
Runge Kutta method and the four-stage explicit Runge Kutta method.
